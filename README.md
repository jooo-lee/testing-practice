# Testing Practice

My solution to the [testing practice project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Functions

1. A `capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
1. A `reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
1. A `createCalculator` function that returns a `calculator` object which contains functions for the basic operations: `add`,`subtract`, `divide` and `multiply`. Each of these functions takes two numbers and returns the correct calculation.
1. A `caesarCipher` function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns the string with each letter "shifted". It preserves case, punctuation and whitespace.
1. An `analyzeArray` function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: `average`, `min`, `max` and `length` properties.
